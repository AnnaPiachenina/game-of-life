# game-of-life
Game of life is mathematical simulation or cellular automaton.
Rules:
Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (the cells around it). Every step (or generation), the following rules are applied:

Underpopulation: A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.
Survival: A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Overpopulation: A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.
Reproduction: A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive
